# Azure_Fundamentals_Certificate

I am happy to pass the Azure Fundamentals Exam which proves my knowledge of cloud computing concepts, models, and services such as public, private, and hybrid cloud.
Additionally, the exam also requires a solid understanding of Azure workloads, security, privacy, pricing, and support.
